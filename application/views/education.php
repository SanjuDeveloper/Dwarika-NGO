                           Education is the most basic criteria or the cornerstone of a developed society. The pure rote learning of theorems and literature for education is not learning, but one that focuses on the development of the mind. It is one that helps a person achieve his maximum potential within a given set of resources and shapes him into a well-rounded human being. Education is that which not only teaches its student to take away from the society but gives back to the same society, maintains the society and contributes to its development. Values are an inseparable part of a good education and should be established in the mind of the students, but they should be given the freedom to use those values in their own different way. Any correct value inserted in a child will not be misunderstood or misquoted. A holistic education will ensure that children do not turn into money mining robots but humans who bring to life the lives of one or the other humans. As per the 2011 census, Delhi has a literacy rate of 86.3 percent, with a male literacy rate of 91 percent, while the female literacy rate is only 80.9 percent, which is closer to the national literacy rate of 74.04 percent. This shows that female literacy remains a major challenge in the national capital. This phenomenon can be attributed to many factors that are nature as well as cultural and religious socio-economic. Female literacy has a direct impact on the growth of the economy among other things like other literacy rate, malnutrition etc. These figures show us primarily that we still have a long way to go to achieve 100 percent literacy, which has been continued by the United Nations. Development Goal 2030 as well as our national aspiration for a bright and shining India. We as citizens of this country have a duty to our fellow citizens to ensure that all (men, women, children, transgenders) get fair opportunities for growth and development. And education is to ensure the achievement of primary growth and development that we want and aspire to. Therefore, while recognizing this important goal, we at Dwarka Club Federation are promoting literacy and education through various awareness programs, seminars, interactive sessions so that beneficiaries realize the importance of sending both girls and boys to school and We also brought through various programs. To enable children from poor socio-economic backgrounds to attend school.
